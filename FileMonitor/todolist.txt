Todo:
- 
- Add multiple folders at once?
- Update UI to allow user to edit files that have been moved, deleted, or renamed
- If the user deletes a file that was added from a monitored folder, display a message informing them that the file will be re-added. Offer option to ignore files instead.
- No references to "RemoveRange()" in the Repository class. The service classes should use Remove for a single value, and RemoveRange for a range of values.
- Set database IDs to reuse unused IDs?

Fixes:
- Delete buttons should be greyed out until at least one checkbox is selected
- TreeView does not add a parent folder when it is part of a monitored child folder
- Window Mousedown only works in the Main tab, not the settings tab
- The ListView item width breaks when the width is greater than the ListView itself

Features:
- Offer setting for constant watch? Use the FileSystemWatcher class for this
- NOTE: the program will break if paths are linked to removable storage media and the drive letter changes. Documentation will recommend the following: if using removable storage media for this app, suggest using permanent
drive letters. Second, if the drive letter changes and breaks the path, offer the option to search the database for the user, i.e. "Backup path not found. Do you wish to search the database for the file(s)?". Third, there 
needs to be an option to migrate paths from an old drive to a new drive.

- Possible settings controls:
1. Create a zip file?
2. Create a scheduled task in Windows?
3. Choose whether or not to name the file paths
4. Display paths as list or treeview
5. Add Folder adds all files in all subdirectories (option to disable)
6. Allow ignore files
