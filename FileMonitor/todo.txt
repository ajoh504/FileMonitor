Fixes:
- Edit MainWindow to use the SQL file path
- rename FileTextBlockDisplay -- will separate into two classes, AllFiles and RecentlyChangedFiles. NOTE: must edit event handler to reflect the new class name
- Remove the FileTextBlockDisplay object from the beginning of the program execution
- Update textblocks from database / remove JSON file references 
- Show file paths that have changed in TextBlock
- Add helper class / helper methods to format how the text is displayed (ex. show the date modified)

Features:
- Allow user to add dir. Display warning: adding a dir will add all files and subfiles from that dir. If you want to add only specific files, you must add each file individually
- Display "all files" in a TreeView
- Offer setting for constant watch? Use the FileSystemWatcher class for this
- NOTE: the program will break if paths are linked to removable storage media and the drive letter changes. Documentation will recommend the following: if using removable storage media for this app, suggest using permanent
drive letters. Second, if the drive letter changes and breaks the path, offer the option to search the database for the user, i.e. "Backup path not found. Do you wish to search the database for the file(s)?". Third, there 
needs to be an option to migrate paths from an old drive to a new drive.

- Settings controls:
1. Create a zip file?
2. Create a scheduled task in Windows?
3. Choose whether or not to name the file paths
